# Base Setup:
1. Project initialized with Git + NPM
2. Installed core backend dependencies (Express, Mongoose, etc.)
3. Created structured folder layout
4. Connected MongoDB with connectDB()
5. Created base server with Express
6. Configured environment variables with .env

# Models (Data Layer):
1. userModel.js:
a. Fields: name, email, password
b. Password hashing with bcryptjs
c. matchPassword() method for login
2. taskModel.js:
a. Fields: title, description, completed, user
b. user is a foreign key via mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId

# Core Features Built:
1. Auth System (JWT based):
a. registerUser: POST /api/auth/register
b. loginUser: POST /api/auth/login
c. generateToken.js: signs JWT
d. Password hashing & comparison handled
e. Token returned on successful login/registration
f. Get the profile of logged-in user: GET /api/auth/me

2. Auth Routes
a. POST /api/auth/register
b. POST /api/auth/login
c. GET /api/auth/me

# Authorization Middleare
1. authMiddleware.js created
2. Validates JWT
3. Extracts & attaches req.user to requests
4. All /api/tasks routes are now protected

# Task CRUD Features:
1. createTask: create tasks (by logged-in user only) -> /api/tasks/createTask
2. getTasks: get user's tasks (by logged-in user only) -> /api/tasks/getTasks
3. updateTask: update task (by logged-in user only) -> /api/tasks/:id
4. deleteTask: delete task (by logged-in user only) -> /api/tasks/:id
5. All task routes are protected via JWT.

## Validation:
Input validation is handled using Joi. This ensures that incoming data to our API meets the expected format before it hits the database.

Validation applies to:

1. POST /api/auth/register â€” Validates username, email, password
2. POST /api/auth/login â€” Validates email, password
3. POST /api/tasks â€” Validates title (required), optional description/status
4. PUT /api/tasks/:id â€” All fields optional, but validated if present

All schemas are defined in /src/validators and used inside controller files.

## Error Handling:
We use a centralized error handling middleware to catch and handle errors across the app. This helps return consistent error responses and avoids repeating try/catch logic everywhere.

# Features:
1. Catches all next(err) calls in controllers
2. Returns JSON error response with status code and message
3. Hides stack trace in production for security

Middleware is defined in /src/middleware/errorMiddleware.js and registered in app.js.

ðŸ§ª Pro tip: Validate early, crash never.
